Ergatis [215],yes,yes,"Linux, MAC OS X, Windows",yes,no,yes,Yes,"Web-based workflow management system for configuring and monitoring pipelines; offers components for BWA, bowtie without executables and is due to its complexity aimed at bioinformaticians;"
Galaxy [216],yes,yes,"Linux, MAC OS X",yes,no,yes,yes,"Web-based platform for performing, reproducing, and sharing complete analyses; The system offers graphical workflow editing and includes many built-in NGS tools. Users can add new tools and share them with the community."
Genboree Workbench [217],yes,yes,"Linux, MAC OS X, Windows",yes,no,yes,Yes,It is a platform for deploying genomic tools as a service and offers a web-based drag and drop interface. Tasks are executed on a compute cluster and data can be uploaded as tracks. The system cannot be installed locally. 
GenePattern [218],yes,yes,"Linux, MAC OS X, Windows",yes,no,yes,No,Scientific workflow system that provides access to more than 150 genomic analysis tools;
GeneProf [219],yes,yes,Linux (it is not tested on  Others yet),yes,no,yes,No,"A web-based, graphical software suite for the analysis of NGS data; To complete the installation IT experience is required."
Kepler (bioKepler) [220],yes,yes,"Linux, MAC OS X, Windows;  > 1 GB RAM,  2 GHz CPU ",yes,no,no,No,Free software with a graphic user interface system for managing scientific workflows; supports hierarchy in workflows to create modular components.;
KNIME [221],yes,-,"Linux, MAC OS X, Windows",yes,yes,no,Yes,"Open source platform for graphically building and editing workflows and data analysis pipelines; includes some NGS analysis programs, which are mostly for filtering and manipulating VCF files;"
LONI Pipeline [222],yes,yes,"Linux, MAC OS X, Windows",yes,yes,no,No,Workflow processing application where executables can be used by creating dedicated wrappers; provides a few NGS analysis pipelines and users can apply for an account to download and use the software;
Moa [223],yes,yes,Linux,yes,yes,no,No,"The command line based management system allows users to write and executes workflows; offers some NGS support, mainly for aligning reads to a reference genome;"
Tavaxy [224],yes,yes,Linux,yes,no,yes,Yes,"The tool combines the web interface of Galaxy, with the complexity of Taverna."
Taverna [225],yes,yes,"Linux, MAC OS X, Windows",yes,yes,no,yes,"Open source, web-service based workflow management application with a large library of existing tools that operate on genomic sequences; does not ship with any prepackaged sequence analysis tools and integrating the tools requires some programming experience;"
Yabi [226],-,-,Linux,yes,yes,yes,yes,"Currently, only a trial version is available and users need to request for an account. The public available version does not contain predefined workflows for NGS analysis."
