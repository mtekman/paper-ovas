abstract ={Summary: HaploPainter is a user-friendly pedigree-drawing application with special features for easy visualization of complex haplotype information. It has been developed to facilitate gene mapping in Mendelian diseases in terms of fast and reliable definition of the smallest critical interval harbouring the underlying gene defect. HaploPainter is written in Perl and may be used for visualization of haplotypes calculated by any of the common linkage programs. With special features like haplotype compression or the ability of marker section cut-out it particularly addresses the requirements for viewing large haplotypes as obtained by using for genome scans high-density marker panels of many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).Availability: http://haplopainter.sourceforge.net/Contact: holger.thiele@uni-koeln.de},

        abstract = {Detection of genotyping errors and integration of such errors in statistical analysis are relatively neglected topics, given their importance in gene mapping. A few inopportunely placed erro
rs, if ignored, can tremendously affect evidence for linkage. The present study takes a fresh look at the calculation of pedigree likelihoods in the presence of genotyping error. To accommodate genotyping error
, we present extensions to the Lander-Green-Kruglyak deterministic algorithm for small pedigrees and to the Markov-chain Monte Carlo stochastic algorithm for large pedigrees. These extensions can accommodate a
variety of error models and refrain from simplifying assumptions, such as allowing, at most, one error per pedigree. In principle, almost any statistical genetic analysis can be performed taking errors into acc
ount, without actually correcting or deleting suspect genotypes. Three examples illustrate the possibilities. These examples make use of the full pedigree data, multiple linked markers, and a prior error model.
 The first example is the estimation of genotyping error rates from pedigree data. The second-and currently most useful-example is the computation of posterior mistyping probabilities. These probabilities cover
 both Mendelian-consistent and Mendelian-inconsistent errors. The third example is the selection of the true pedigree structure connecting a group of people from among several competing pedigree structures. Pat
ernity testing and twin zygosity testing are typical applications.},

        abstract = {In complex disease studies, it is crucial to perform multipoint linkage analysis with many markers and to use robust nonparametric methods that take account of all pedigree information. Curr
ently available methods fall short in both regards. In this paper, we describe how to extract complete multipoint inheritance information from general pedigrees of moderate size. This information is captured in
 the multipoint inheritance distribution, which provides a framework for a unified approach to both parametric and nonparametric methods of linkage analysis. Specifically, the approach includes the following: (
1) Rapid exact computation of multipoint LOD scores involving dozens of highly polymorphic markers, even in the presence of loops and missing data. (2) Non-parametric linkage (NPL) analysis, a powerful new appr
oach to pedigree analysis. We show that NPL is robust to uncertainty about mode of inheritance, is much more powerful than commonly used nonparametric methods, and loses little power relative to parametric link
age analysis. NPL thus appears to be the method of choice for pedigree studies of complex traits. (3) Information-content mapping, which measures the fraction of the total inheritance information extracted by t
he available marker data and points out the regions in which typing additional markers is most useful. (4) Maximum-likelihood reconstruction of many-marker haplotypes, even in pedigrees with missing data. We ha
ve implemented NPL analysis, LOD-score computation, information-content mapping, and haplotype reconstruction in a new computer package, GENEHUNTER. The package allows efficient multipoint analysis of pedigree
data to be performed rapidly in a single user-friendly environment.},
