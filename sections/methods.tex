\app consists of a series of inter-connecting Bash shell scripts which serve as necessary framework to accommodate wrappers for subsequent modules in order to chain (or "pipe") them together, as well as provide anchors for static and dynamic data management throughout general operation as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:structure}.
