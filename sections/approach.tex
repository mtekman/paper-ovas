\section{Approach}

The core ideology behind \app is to preserve the VCF specification, and this is catered to extensively within the pipeline, where each annotation and filtration module inputs and outputs VCF file(s) in order to facilitate the chaining of subsequent pipeline modules downstream. This allows for full analysis transparency, where results can be extracted at any stage of an ongoing analysis. 

The explicitly open nature of pipeline also prompts a predilection towards open-source or scripted languages and frameworks, which further serve to uphold the confidence between the end-user and their data.

Though core operations are managed primarily through back-end shell scripts, the pipeline can be accessed and configured through a web-front interface  in order to cater for simplicity and user-operability. Users can upload their data either through the web-interface or by manual file placement

Pre-existing annotations within input data are ignored by the pipeline and are supplanted by the pipeline's own annotations in order for it to work with an 

The pipeline disregards any external annotation detected within the input variants,
