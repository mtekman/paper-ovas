\subsubsection{Core Annotation}

The annotation stages of the pipeline prime the variants with relevant metadata that will then be filtered against user-criterion throughout the rest of the pipeline. The annotation stage is the only mandatory stage of the pipeline, and a great portion of filtering occurs at these stages too, with up to 90\% of  true negatives being discarded.

As a result of the large demand placed upon these modules, they were written in the C++ in order to reduce time and memory constraints on low-end platforms.
