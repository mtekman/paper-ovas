\section{Discussion}

In order to reduce the number of false positives, many suites make use of extraneous databases in order to favour some variants over others based on previous analyses through learning mechanisms cite(Illumina knowledge base). Though such methods do produce a more useful subset of variants, they are hard to quantify due to the "black-box" nature in which their results were derived cite(some study shitting on illumina), creating disparity between the end-user and their analysis.

Transparent filtering methods are more likelier to instil greater confidence in the data with the added benefit of customization to better tailor a filter to an analysis in the case of open-source implementations.



The portability of \app grants a major advantage over present-day web-based pipelines because it keeps all analyses securely \textit{in situ}. This lends a significant benefit to regions in the world without consistent or active internet

can operate completely without an active internet connection with the added benefit of keeping all analyses \textit{in situ}.
