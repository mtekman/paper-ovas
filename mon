Hi, eduroam is still down so I only have internet every time I walk down the corridoor.

I put in as much as your changes as I could manage, except a few:

[Intro]
-- I left most of what I wrote, mostly because I pretty much already based it on your existing introduction but 'spiced up'. I think I covered everything you talk about, but if not let me know and I'll work it in.


[Inheritance Filtering]
 - I tried to simplify HOM, so I think we're saying the same thing now: i.e. hom->hom for affected parent to affected offspring
 

 [Extended annotation]
  -- Added transcriptopn and housekeeping sentence to last sentence in conclusion


[Results]
 - Second Case. What was the type of mutation filter? Is the single causative variant missense/nonsense?
 - Third case. Why was the AAF filter applied, and what were the thresholds?



Let me know if anything else needs changing before send off to Horia.

Cheers,
Mehmet
